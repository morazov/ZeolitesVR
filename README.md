# ZeolitesVR

This Unity project implements a virtual reality environment to visualize zeolite frameworks. The resulting build is sufficiently optimized to run on standalone devices such as Quest 2. However, PCVR should be used for a smoother experience, if available.

The frameworks are rendered procedurally from pre-computed atomic coordiantes (see [the Zeolite_CIF_Parser repo](https://github.com/morazov/Zeolite_CIF_Parser) for details). All frameworks listed on the [IZA Database of Zeolite Structures](https://america.iza-structure.org/IZA-SC/ftc_table.php) are included in this project, along with a summary of their crystallographic information.

Several display styles are included, allowing for different interaction modes, as shown below.

A selection of small molecules may be used to gauge the scale of pore channels.
